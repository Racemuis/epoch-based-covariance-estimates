# Epoch based covariance matrices
This is the repository where I store the code that I have used for my Bachelor thesis. This repository includes files with which I have generated the figures for my thesis and my presentation, as well as the source code of my methods and results sections. 

## References & Licenses
My methods are based on the paper listed at [1]. The source files that accompany the paper are released under the MIT license. They can be found in the [following repository](https://github.com/jsosulski/time-decoupled-lda). Moreover, this project relies heavily on the [pyRiemann library](https://zenodo.org/record/18982#.YLdhSKgzZPY) [2] and the [Mother of All BCI Benchmarks (MOABB)](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) [3]. As the firstmentioned source files did not come in a pip-able package, I had to copy some of the files to my own repository. The license has been reproduced in the corresponding source files.
