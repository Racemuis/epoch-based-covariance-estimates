    Creation of the data matrix dedicated to ERP processing
    combined with Xdawn spatial filtering. A complete description of the
    method is available in [1].
    The advantage of this estimation is to reduce dimensionality of the
    covariance matrices efficiently.
    Parameters
    ----------
    nfilter: int (default 4)
        number of Xdawn filter per classes.
    applyfilters: bool (default True)
        if set to true, spatial filter are applied to the prototypes and the
        signals. When set to False, filters are applied only to the ERP prototypes
        allowing for a better generalization across subject and session at the
        expense of dimensionality increase. In that case, the estimation is
        similar to ERPCovariances with `svd=nfilter` but with more compact
        prototype reduction.
    classes : list of int | None (default None)
        list of classes to take into account for prototype estimation.
        If None (default), all classes will be accounted.
    xdawn_estimator : string (default: 'scm')
        covariance matrix estimator for xdawn spatial filtering.
    baseline_cov : baseline_cov : array, shape(n_chan, n_chan) | None (default)
        baseline_covariance for xdawn. see `Xdawn`.
